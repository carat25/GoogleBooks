# Introduction
This is a simple book search engine exactly like google books and is using the google books API. The website contains a main search bar which allows user to display books filtered as per user's query. The books returned contains an image of the book (if available), the book title, the author/s and the book description.

# Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
* Give feedback to the user when no book results can be found for the query
* When user clicks a book in the grid, a modal should appear with more book information (e.g. release date, publish date, country, languages, etc.
